LiquidRescale Library Manual
============================

The library manual is provided in docbook format.
You can compile an html version of it by just issuing `make'.

However, this assumes that your html specification is located at:

/usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/nwalsh/html/chunk.xsl

If this is not the case, edit the file `lqr_style' accordingly.

After compilation, the file `liblqr_manual.html' will point to
the manual index.
