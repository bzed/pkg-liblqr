liblqr (0.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Version
    This is a bugfix release. It fixes a serious bug with 16bit images
    (therefore, it is actually irrelevant to GIMP users, not so for other
    programs such as ImageMagick and DigiKam). 
  * debian/rules: Be pendantic about symbol changes

liblqr (0.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Version
  * debian/watch:
    - Updating watch file to fit the new filename. 
  * debian/liblqr-1-0.symbols:
    - In the last version of the library several symbols were not marked as
      private by upstream, they are missing now. As the library is new and
      only used by one Gimp plugin now and the abi did not change for the
      plugin, there was no soname bump.
  * debian/rules:
    - Install manpages on build.
  * debian/liblqr-1-0-dev.manpages:
    - Adding file, instaaling devel manpages into the -dev package.
